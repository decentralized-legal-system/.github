# Decentralized Legal System

The Decentralized Legal System (DLS) is an open-source toolkit for creating enforceable private law on Ethereum. It enables groups of independent persons to collaboratively draft, vote on, and permanently record binding standards, shared principles, and individual contracts. Built on existing infrastructure (Ethereum, Arweave, Snapshot), the DLS bridges the gap between blockchain technology and human-readable law.

This organization hosts the software implementations of the DLS framework. Each product is a standalone, forkable application that can be deployed independently. Together, they form a complete ecosystem for decentralized lawmaking, contract creation, and governance — from a simple stakeholder vote to a fully decentralized consensus jurisdiction. For the theoretical foundations, see [Decentralized Law](https://github.com/decentralized-law).
